INSTRUCTIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
right click the roblox file on your desktop, then hit Open File Location
(or you can use the path C:\Users\(name)\AppData\Local\Roblox\Versions\[placeholder name for current roblox version]
(replace '(name)' with your computer user name thingy)
drag and drop the folders over the version folder
OH and dont forget after each update roblox replaces EVERYTHING so you gotta check every once in a while
