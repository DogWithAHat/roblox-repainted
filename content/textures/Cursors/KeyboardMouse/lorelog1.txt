yo, my name is soips, im from brick-hill, im a vaporeon who is aware that im in a video game, and i moved to 'bloxia about a month ago

and i think things are going well
(im also writing this so i can look back on this in like a year or something and then go "oh yeah i remember that lol")

uh
first off, people arent shaped like squares. imagine the whiplash you would get by seeing people your whole life as blocky and then you decide to move to another place
then it just hits you like a brick when you see A REAL DUDE!!! WHAT!!!!!! I STILL CANT GET OVER IT WHAT THE FUCJK!!!!

anyways, i think i've also made a couple friends? maybe? i know some dog guy named lemon, i think he's nice, i dont really know for sure.
i also have zero idea of where i am, but i think this place is called dootspire? i forgot, but this is a pretty nice uh
what the fuck do you call this, a hotel? a tower? whatever
i also met a dude named shmoover in some really big city, but all the buildings seemed to be fake, but i digress.
shmoover is the coolest dude i've ever met i swear on all my on about this

thats about it for now, take care.
(im also gonna call these things lorelogs)
